I recently enrolled myself in 'Learning how to Learn' course on coursera. [Part 1](../learning-how-to-learn-1) of this series listed my motivations for doing so, and summary of week 1 of the course.

Before summarizing my learnings from week 2, I would like to go over the things that have stuck with me from week 1. These techniques have passed the test of time(2 weeks, hah) :

* [Pomodoro Technique][1] :  I have found this to be very effective. I now work on things 25 min at a time, and try not to be distracted in between. I don't know if my productivity has increased but my focus and attention span sure has. 
* Solving problems without looking at solutions : I have not been able to use this as much as I would have liked, but a few times that I got the opportunity, I came out with a better understanding of the subject.

Week 2 of the course focussed on chunking information i.e. breaking down information into smaller logical pieces. It also went over the concepts of 'illusion of competence' and 'reward based learning'([Treat. Yo. Self][2])
