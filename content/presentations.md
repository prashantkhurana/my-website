In the last few years I gave a bunch of presentations. This is a collection of those. At the time, I was not focussing on publishing them so some of the content would be missing as I did not document everything. Feel free to contact me if anything piques your interest. 

1) Rust presentation with focus on differentiating features of rust ie. owenership, borrowing and lifetimes. [Github Link][1]

2) Graph Databases : Neo4j. [Google slides link][2].

3) Vuejs : A progressive javascript framework. [Google Slides Link][3]

4) Java concurrency in practice : Overview of JcStress, a stress testing tool. [Google Slides Link][4] 

5) Refactoring to patterns : Collection of a few not so known patterns from the famous book 'Refactoring to patterns'. [Google Slides Link][5]

6) JUnit5: I gave this talk when Junit5 was few months away, hopefully all things mentioned here made it in. [Google Slides Link][6]

7) Protocol Buffers : We heavily use protocol buffers at Dstillery for storing data and communication. [Google Slides Link][7]
