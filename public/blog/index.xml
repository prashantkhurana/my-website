      <description>I recently enrolled myself in &amp;lsquo;Learning how to Learn&amp;rsquo; course on coursera. Part 1 of this series listed my motivations for doing so, and summary of week 1 of the course.

 I decided to deep dive into it and thought that I can do a quick glance of the course in a few weeks whereas the recommended time to finish the course is 3 months.</description>
