<p>Recently I decided to take a popular course on Coursera : <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/home">Learning how to learn</a>.</p>

<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>

<p>I had been trying to go over <a href="http://course.fast.ai/">deep learning course</a> on fast.ai and somehow I was not making progress and hence started to procrastinate. In retrospect there are a few reasons I can think of, as to why I gave up on the course(for the time being) :</p>

<ul>
<li>I decided to deep dive into it and thought that I can do a quick glance of the course in a few weeks whereas the recommended time to finish the course is 3 months.</li>
<li>I watched 2 videos (out of 7) along with the homework in 4 days but realized that I was not retaining much knowledge.</li>
<li>The python libraries that were used in the first 2 lectures seemed like magic to me. The professor did mention that what these libraries were doing will be studied in detail later on, but I did not have the  patience and started to learn about them, taking on more work.<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>Hence I was overwhelmed and there being no pressing need to for me to learn about deep learning, I started to look at other interesting things to do.</p>

<p>That is when I found out about the learning how to learn course. The timing seemed pretty apt so I decided I would take the course. The takeaways I was looking for were exactly what the course title suggests : learning how to learn new subjects.</p>

<p>As I am taking the course I will outline my notes here. This post consists of the notes from week 1 of the course.</p>

<h1 id="learning-how-to-learn">Learning how to learn</h1>

<h1 id="week-1">Week 1</h1>

<h3 id="focused-and-diffused-modes">Focused and diffused modes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Analogies help a lot while learning. Associations to existing concepts is helpful.</li>
<li>Mind works in focussed and diffused modes.

<ul>
<li>Work in focused mode for some time and then in diffused mode.</li>
<li>Let your mind run free for some time.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="procrastination">Procrastination</h3>

<p><img src="Procrastination.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="pomodoro">Pomodoro</h4>

<p><img src="Pomodoro.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Similar to intense workout followed by relaxation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="practice-makes-perfection">Practice makes perfection</h3>

<ul>
<li>When you first see a solution to a problem, the neural pattern of the solution in your brain(though present) is weak.</li>
<li>When you solve the problem the second time on your own, without looking at the solution, the neural pattern becomes stronger.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="introduction-to-memory">Introduction to memory</h3>

<ul>
<li>Two types of memory : long term memory and working memory.</li>
<li>Working memory : Related to what you are working right now.

<ul>
<li>Repetition is sometimes needed to keep stuff in working memory, until we have a chance to write the content down.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Longterm memory

<ul>
<li>Store fundamental concepts about various subjects.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Spaced repetition :

<ul>
<li>Repeat the thing you are trying to learn over several days.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t try to repeat one thing 10 times in one day. Span it across days.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="few-extra-points">Few extra points</h3>

<ul>
<li>Learn by active engagement rather than passive listening.

<ul>
<li>Reading tutorials is a good starting point but <em>learning by doing</em> is important.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Success does not come alone with smartness.

<ul>
<li>Common qualities amongst successful people are persistence and being passionate about the work they do.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
