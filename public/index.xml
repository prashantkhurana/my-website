      <description>I recently enrolled myself in &amp;lsquo;Learning how to Learn&amp;rsquo; course on coursera. Part 1 of this series listed my motivations for doing so, and summary of week 1 of the course.
Before summarizing my learnings from week 2, I would like to go over the things that have stuck with me from week 1. These techniques have passed the test of time(a month, hah) :
 Pomodoro Technique : I have found this to be very effective.</description>

      <description>Recently I decided to take one of the most popular courses on Coursera : Learning how to learn.
Motivation I had been trying to go over deep learning course on fast.ai and somehow I was not making progress and hence started to procrastinate. In retrospect there are a few reasons I can think of, as to why I gave up on the course(for the time being) :
 I decided to deep dive into it and thought that I can do a quick glance of the course in a few weeks whereas the recommended time to finish the course is 3 months.</description>

      <description>In the last few years I gave a bunch of presentations. This is a collection of those. At the time, I was not focussing on publishing them, so some of the content would be missing as I did not document everything. Feel free to contact me if anything piques your interest.
1) Rust presentation with focus on differentiating features of rust ie. owenership, borrowing and lifetimes. Github Link
2) Graph Databases : Neo4j.</description>
