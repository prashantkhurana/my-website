      <description>Recently I decided to take a popular course on Coursera : Learning how to learn.
Motivation I had been trying to go over deep learning course on fast.ai and somehow I was not making progress and hence started to procrastinate. In retrospect there are a few reasons I can think of, as to why I gave up on the course(for the time being) :
 I decided to deep dive into it and thought that I can do a quick glance of the course in a few weeks whereas the recommended time to finish the course is 3 months.</description>

      <description>In the last few years I gave a bunch of presentations. This is a collection of those. At the time, I was not focussing on publishing them, so some of the content would be missing as I did not document everything. Feel free to contact me if anything piques your interest.
1) Rust presentation with focus on differentiating features of rust ie. owenership, borrowing and lifetimes. Github Link
2) Graph Databases : Neo4j.</description>
